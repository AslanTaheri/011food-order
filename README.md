# AvocaDoor

This project was my first practice in React. It is only a front end, that serves as a grocery shopping store front.
It is more ideal for a headless ecommerce situation where it can be connected to a backend provider such as Shopify. 
However, I am more interested in designing the full stack web apps and that is why I took on my next practice  project, Restaurants,
which you also can see on my Github.
